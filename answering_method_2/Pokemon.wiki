The franchise began as a pair of video games for the original [[Game Boy]], developed by [[Game Freak]] and published by [[Nintendo]].

This was fixed in [[Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen|''FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'']].)

==Concept==
Tajiri first thought of Pokémon around 1989 or 1990, when the [[Game Boy]] was first released.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ASIANOW/time/magazine/99/1122/pokemon6.fullinterview1.html|title=The Ultimate Game Freak|date=1999-11-22|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|location=Asia|volume=154|issue=20|accessdate=2015-02-02}}</ref> The concept of the [[Pokémon universe]], in both the video games and the general fictional world of Pokémon, stems from the hobby of [[insect collecting]], a popular pastime which Pokémon executive director Satoshi Tajiri enjoyed as a child.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2040095,00.html|title=The Ultimate Game Freak|work=Time|location=U.S.|date=1999-11-22|accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref> Players of the games are designated as [[Pokémon Trainer]]s, and the two general goals (in most Pokémon games) for such Trainers are: to complete the [[Pokédex]] by collecting all of the available Pokémon species found in the fictional region where that game takes place; and to train a team of powerful Pokémon from those they have caught to compete against teams owned by other Trainers, and eventually become the strongest Trainer: the Pokémon Master. These themes of collecting, training, and battling are present in almost every version of the Pokémon franchise, including the [[Pokémon (video game series)|video games]], the [[Pokémon (anime)|anime]] and manga series, and the [[Pokémon Trading Card Game]].

In most incarnations of the fictional Pokémon universe, a Trainer that encounters a wild Pokémon is able to capture that Pokémon by throwing a specially designed, mass-producible spherical tool called a [[Poké Ball]] at it. If the Pokémon is unable to escape the confines of the Poké Ball, it is officially considered to be under the ownership of that Trainer. Afterwards, it will obey whatever its new master commands, unless the Trainer demonstrates such a lack of experience that the Pokémon would rather act on its own accord. Trainers can send out any of their Pokémon to wage non-lethal battles against other Pokémon; if the opposing Pokémon is wild, the Trainer can capture that Pokémon with a Poké Ball, increasing his or her collection of creatures. Pokémon already owned by other Trainers cannot be captured, except under special circumstances in certain games. If a Pokémon fully defeats an opponent in battle so that the opponent is knocked out (i.e., "faints"), the winning Pokémon gains [[experience point]]s and may level up. When leveling up, the Pokémon's statistics ("[[Pokémon statistics|stats]]") of battling aptitude increase, such as Attack and Speed. From time to time the Pokémon may also learn new [[Pokémon moves|moves]], which are techniques used in battle. In addition, many species of Pokémon possess the ability to undergo a form of [[metamorphosis]] and transform into a similar but stronger species of Pokémon, a process called [[Pokémon evolution|evolution]].

In the main series, each game's single-player mode requires the Trainer to raise a team of Pokémon to defeat many [[non-player character]] (NPC) Trainers and their Pokémon. Each game lays out a somewhat linear path through a specific region of the Pokémon world for the Trainer to journey through, completing events and battling opponents along the way. Each game features eight especially powerful Trainers, referred to as [[Gym Leader]]s, that the Trainer must defeat in order to progress. As a reward, the Trainer receives a Gym Badge, and once all eight badges are collected, that Trainer is eligible to challenge the region's Pokémon League, where four immensely talented trainers (referred to collectively as the "[[Elite Four]]") challenge the Trainer to four Pokémon battles in succession. If the trainer can overcome this gauntlet, he or she must then challenge the Regional Champion, the master Trainer who had previously defeated the Elite Four. Any Trainer who wins this last battle becomes the new champion.

===Generations===
<!--Please don't delete/rename this header as it is linked to/from a number of places.-->The original Pokémon games were role-playing games (RPGs) with an element of strategy, and were created by [[Satoshi Tajiri]] for the [[Game Boy]]. These RPGs, and their sequels, [[Video game remake|remakes]], and English language translations, are still considered the "main" Pokémon games, and the games which most fans of the series are referring to when they use the term "Pokémon games". All of the licensed Pokémon properties overseen by [[The Pokémon Company International]] are divided roughly by generation. These generations are roughly [[chronology|chronological]] divisions by release; every several years, when an official sequel in the main RPG series is released that features new Pokémon, characters, and gameplay concepts, that sequel is considered the start of a new generation of the franchise. The main games and their spin-offs, the anime, manga, and trading card game are all updated with the new Pokémon properties each time a new generation begins. The franchise began the sixth generation on October 12, 2013.
[[File:Bulbasaur pokemon red.png|thumb|right|A battle between a level 5 [[Bulbasaur]] and a level 5 [[Charmander]] in ''Pokémon Yellow''<ref>{{cite book|title=Pokémon Trainer's Guide|year=1999|publisher=Sandwich Islands Publishing|isbn=0-439-15404-9|page=73|author=MacDonald, Mark; Brokaw, Brian; Arnold; J. Douglas; Elies, Mark}}</ref>]]

The Pokémon franchise started off in its first generation with its initial release of [[Pokémon Red and Green|''Pocket Monsters Aka'' and ''Midori'']] ("Red" and "Green", respectively) for the Game Boy in Japan. When these games proved extremely popular, an enhanced ''Ao'' ("[[Pokémon Red and Blue#Pocket Monsters: Blue|Blue]]") version was released sometime after, and the ''Ao'' version was reprogrammed as ''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'' for international release. The games launched in the United States on September 30, 1998. The original ''Aka'' and ''Midori'' versions were never released outside of Japan.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pokémon Green Info on GameFAQs|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/924467-pokemon-green/data|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=February 23, 2007}}</ref> Afterwards, a further enhanced version titled ''[[Pokémon Yellow: Special Pikachu Edition]]'' was released to partially take advantage of the color palette of the [[Game Boy Color]], as well as to feature more elements from the popular Pokémon anime. This first generation of games introduced the original 151 species of Pokémon, in National Pokédex order, encompassing all Pokémon from Bulbasaur to [[Mew (Pokémon)|Mew]]. It also introduced the basic game concepts of capturing, training, battling, and trading Pokémon with both computer and human players. These versions of the games take place within the fictional [[Kanto (Pokémon)|Kanto]] region, inspired by the real world [[Kantō region]] of Japan, though the name "Kanto" was not used until the second generation.

The second generation of Pokémon began in 1999 with the release of [[Pokémon Gold and Silver|''Pokémon Gold'' and ''Silver'']] for Game Boy Color. Like the previous generation, an enhanced version titled ''[[Pokémon Crystal]]'' was later released. The second generation introduced 100 new species of Pokémon, starting with [[Chikorita]] and ending with [[Celebi (Pokémon)|Celebi]]. It totaled 251 Pokémon to collect, train, and battle, set in [[Johto]], inspired by Japan's [[Kansai region]]. The [[Pokémon mini]] is a [[handheld game console]] released in November 2001 in North America, December 2001 in Japan, and 2002 in Europe.

Pokémon entered its third generation with the 2002 release of [[Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pokémon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']] for [[Game Boy Advance]] and continued with the Game Boy Advance remakes of ''Pokémon Red and Blue'', ''Pokémon FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'', and an enhanced version of ''Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire'' titled ''[[Pokémon Emerald]]''. The third generation introduced 135 new Pokémon, starting with [[Treecko]] and ending with [[Deoxys]], for a total of 386 species. It is set in [[Hoenn]], inspired by Japan's [[Kyushu]] region. However, this generation also garnered some criticism for leaving out several gameplay features, including the day-and-night system introduced in the previous generation. It was also the first installment that encouraged the player to collect merely a selected assortment of the total number of Pokémon rather than every existing species. By contrast, 202 out of 386 species are catchable in the ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' versions.

In 2006, Japan began the fourth generation of the franchise with the release of [[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl|''Pokémon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']] for Nintendo DS. The fourth generation introduced another 107 new species of Pokémon, starting with [[Turtwig]] and ending with [[Arceus]], bringing the total of Pokémon species to 493.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://au.ds.ign.com/articles/778/778464p1.html |title=The Countdown to Diamond and Pearl, Part 4|publisher=IGN|author=Lucas M. Thomas|date=April 4, 2007|accessdate=June 29, 2008}}</ref> The [[Nintendo DS]] "touch screen" allows new features to the game such as cooking poffins with the stylus and using the "Pokétch". New gameplay concepts include a restructured [[Types of Pokémon moves|move]]-classification system, online multiplayer trading and battling via [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]], the return and expansion of the second generation's day-and-night system, the expansion of the third generation's Pokémon Contests into "Super Contests", and the new region of [[Sinnoh]]. This region was inspired by Japan's [[Hokkaido]] region and part of Russia's [[Sakhalin]], and has an underground component for multiplayer gameplay in addition to the main overworld. ''[[Pokémon Platinum]]'', the enhanced version of Diamond and Pearl—much like ''Pokémon Yellow'', ''Crystal'', and ''Emerald''—was released in September 2008 in Japan, March 2009 in North America, and May 2009 in Australia and Europe. Spin-off titles in the fourth generation include the ''Pokémon Stadium'' follow-up ''[[Pokémon Battle Revolution]]'' for [[Wii]], which has Wi-Fi connectivity as well.<ref>{{cite web|last=Riley|first=Adam|title=Cubed3 Nintendo News < Features|url=http://www.cubed3.com/news/5349|publisher=Cubed3|accessdate=June 7, 2006|date=June 7, 2006}}</ref> Nintendo announced in May 2009 that enhanced remakes of ''Pokémon Gold'' and ''Silver'', entitled [[Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver|''Pokémon HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'']], would be released for the Nintendo DS system.

===Game mechanics===
{{Main|Gameplay of Pokémon}}
The main staple of the ''Pokémon'' video game series revolves around the catching and battling of Pokémon. Starting with a starter Pokémon, the player can catch wild Pokémon by weakening them and catching them with Poké Balls. Conversely, they can choose to defeat them in battle in order to gain experience for their Pokémon, raising their levels and teaching them new moves. Certain Pokémon can evolve into more powerful forms by raising their levels or using certain items. Throughout the game, players will have to battle other trainers in order to progress, with the main goal to defeat various Gym Leaders and earn the right to become a tournament champion. Subsequent games in the series have introduced various side games and side quests, including the Battle Frontiers that display unique battle types and the Pokémon Contests where visual appearance is put on display.

====Starter Pokémon====
One of the consistent aspects of the Pokémon games—spanning from ''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'' on the Game Boy to the Nintendo 3DS games ''Pokémon Omega Ruby'' and ''Alpha Sapphire''—is the choice of one of three different Pokémon at the start of the player's adventures; these three are often labeled "starter Pokémon". Players can choose a [[Pokémon types|Grass-type]], a Fire-type, or a Water-type.<ref name=spy>{{cite web|last=Padilla|first=Raymond|title=Pokémon Ruby review|url=http://uk.gba.gamespy.com/gameboy-advance/pokemon-ruby-version/498107p1.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310184236/http://uk.gba.gamespy.com/gameboy-advance/pokemon-ruby-version/498107p1.html|archivedate=March 10, 2007|publisher=Gamespy.com|accessdate=May 30, 2006|page=1|date=March 17, 2003}}</ref> For example, in ''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'' (and their respective remakes, ''Pokémon FireRed'' and ''Pokémon LeafGreen''), the player has the choice of starting with Bulbasaur, Charmander, or [[Squirtle]]. The exception to this rule is ''Pokémon Yellow'' (a remake of the original games that follows the story of the ''Pokémon'' anime), where players are given a Pikachu, an Electric-type mouse Pokémon, famous for being the mascot of the Pokémon media franchise; in this game, however, the three starter Pokémon from ''Red'' and ''Blue'' can be obtained during the quest by a single player, something that is not possible in any other installment of the franchise.<ref>{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Craig|title=Pokemon Yellow: Special Pikachu Edition|url=http://uk.gameboy.ign.com/articles/162/162045p1.html|publisher=IGN|accessdate=March 27, 2006|date=October 19, 1999}}</ref> Another consistent aspect is that the player's rival will always choose as his or her starter Pokémon the one that has a type advantage over the player's Pokémon. For instance, if the player picks a Grass-type Pokémon, the rival will always pick the Fire-type starter. An exception to this is again ''Pokémon Yellow'', in which the rival picks an [[Eevee]], but whether this Eevee evolves into [[Jolteon]], [[Vaporeon]], or [[Flareon]] is decided by when the player wins and loses to the rival through the journey. The [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]] games ''[[Pokémon Colosseum]]'' and ''[[Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness]]'' also contain an exception; whereas in most games the player's initial Pokémon starts at Level 5, in these two games the player's initial Pokémon starts at Levels 10 and 25, respectively. In ''Colosseum'' the player's starter Pokémon are [[Espeon]] and [[Umbreon]], while in ''Gale of Darkness'' the player's starter is Eevee.

====Pokédex====
The [[Gameplay of Pokémon#Pokédex|Pokédex]] is a fictional electronic device featured in the Pokémon [[video game]] and anime series. In the games, whenever a Pokémon is first captured, its data will be added to a player's Pokédex, but in the anime or [[Pokémon Adventures|manga]], the Pokédex is a comprehensive electronic reference encyclopedia, usually referred to in order to deliver [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]]. "Pokédex" is also used to refer to a list of Pokémon, usually a list of Pokémon by number. In the video games, a Pokémon Trainer is issued a blank device at the start of the journey. A trainer must then attempt to fill the Pokédex by encountering and at least briefly obtaining each of the different species of Pokémon. A player will receive the name and image of a Pokémon after encountering one that was not previously in the Pokédex, typically after battling said Pokémon either in the wild or in a trainer battle (with the exceptions of link battles and tournament battles, such as in the Battle Frontier). In ''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'', some Pokémon's data is added to the Pokédex simply by viewing the Pokémon, such as in the zoo outside of the Safari Zone. Also, certain NPC characters may add to the Pokédex by explaining what a Pokémon looks like during conversation. More detailed information is available after the player obtains a member of the species, either through capturing the Pokémon in the wild, evolving a previously captured Pokémon, hatching a Pokémon egg (from the second generation onwards), or through a trade with another trainer (either an NPC or another player). This information includes height, weight, species type, and a short description of the Pokémon. Later versions of the Pokédex have more detailed information, like the size of a certain Pokémon compared to the player character, or Pokémon being sorted by their habitat (so far, the latter feature is only in the ''FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'' versions). The most current forms of Pokédex are capable of containing information on all Pokémon currently known. The GameCube games, ''Pokémon Colosseum'' and ''Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness'', have a Pokémon Digital Assistant ({{Unicode|P★DA}}) which is similar to the Pokédex, but also tells what types are effective against a Pokémon and gives a description of its abilities.<ref>{{cite book|title=Official Pokémon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version|pages=30–31}}</ref>

===Anime series===
{{Main|Pokémon (anime)}}
The Pokémon anime [[Television program|series]] and [[film]]s are a meta-series of adventures separate from the [[canon (fiction)|canon]] that most of the Pokémon video games follow (with the exception of ''Pokémon Yellow'', a game based loosely on the anime storyline). The anime follows the quest of the main character, Ash Ketchum<ref name=ash>{{cite web|title=Pokémon anime overview|url=http://www.psypokes.com/anime/index.php|publisher=Psypokes.com|accessdate=May 25, 2006}}</ref> (known as Satoshi in Japan) a Pokémon Master in training, as he and a small group of friends<ref name=ash/> travel around the fictitious world of Pokémon along with their Pokémon partners. The original series, titled ''Pocket Monsters'', or simply ''Pokémon'' in Western countries (often referred to as ''Pokémon: Gotta Catch 'Em All'' to distinguish it from the later series), begins with Ash's first day as a Pokémon trainer. His first (and signature) Pokémon is a Pikachu, differing from the games, where only Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle could be chosen.<ref>{{cite AV media|title=Pokémon 10th Anniversary, Vol. 1 – Pikachu|publisher=Viz Video|date=June 6, 2006|oclc=68967936}}</ref> The series follows the storyline of the original games, ''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'', in the region of Kanto. Accompanying Ash on his journeys are [[Brock (Pokémon)|Brock]], the Pewter City Gym Leader, and [[Misty (Pokémon)|Misty]], the youngest of the Gym Leader sisters from Cerulean City. ''Pokémon: Adventures in the Orange Islands'' follows Ash's adventures in the Orange Islands, a place unique to the anime, and replaces Brock with [[Tracey Sketchit]], an artist and "Pokémon watcher". The next series, based on the second generation of games, include ''Pokémon: Johto Journeys'', ''Pokémon: Johto League Champions'', and ''Pokémon: Master Quest'', following the original trio of Ash, Brock, and Misty in the western Johto region.

The saga continues in ''Pokémon: Advanced Battle'', based on the third generation games. Ash and company travel to Hoenn, a southern region in the Pokémon World. Ash takes on the role of a teacher and mentor for a novice Pokémon trainer named [[May (Pokémon anime character)|May]]. Her brother [[Max (Pokémon anime character)|Max]] accompanies them, and though he isn't a trainer, he knows large amounts of handy information. Brock (from the original series) soon catches up with Ash, but Misty has returned to Cerulean City to tend to her duties as a gym leader (Misty, along with other recurring characters, appears in the spin-off series ''[[Pokémon Chronicles]]''). The Advanced Battle series concludes with the ''Battle Frontier'' saga, based on the ''Emerald'' version and including aspects of ''FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen''. The Advanced Generation series ended with Max leaving to pick his starter Pokémon and May going to the Grand Festival in Johto.

In the ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'' series, based on the fourth generation games, Ash, Brock, and a new companion, an aspiring Pokémon coordinator named [[Dawn (Pokémon)|Dawn]], travel through the region of Sinnoh. At the end of the series, Ash and Brock return to Kanto where Brock begins to follow his newfound dream of becoming a Pokémon doctor himself.

''[[Pocket Monsters: Best Wishes!]]'', based on the fifth generation games, features Ash and Pikachu traveling through the region of Unova (Isshu in Japan) alongside two new companions, Iris and Cilan (Dent in Japan) who part ways with them after returning to Kanto.

==Criticism and controversy==
<!-- Do not add Controversy without providing reliable sources -->

===Morality and religious beliefs===
Pokémon has been criticized by some [[Christian]]s over perceived [[occult]] and [[violence|violent]] themes and the concept of "Pokémon evolution", which they feel goes against the Biblical creation account in Genesis.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pokémon: The Movie (1999)|url=http://www.capalert.com/capreports/pokemonthemovie.htm|publisher=ChildCare Action Project|accessdate=August 10, 2013|year=1999}}</ref> However, [[TV2000|Sat2000]], a satellite TV station based in [[Vatican City]], has countered that the Pokémon Trading Card Game and video games are "full of inventive imagination" and have no "harmful moral side effects".<ref>{{cite web|last=Silverman|first=Stephen M.|title=Pokemon Gets Religion|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,26334,620818,00.html|publisher=[[People (American magazine)|People]]|accessdate=August 10, 2013|date=December 9, 1997}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Barrett|first=Devlin|title=POKEMON EARNS PAPAL BLESSING|url=http://www.nypostonline.com/news/2630.htm|publisher=New York Post|accessdate=August 10, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000818054740/http://www.nypostonline.com/news/2630.htm|archivedate=August 18, 2000}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, the "Christian Power Cards" game was introduced in 1999 by David Tate who stated, "Some people aren't happy with Pokémon and want an alternative, others just want Christian games."

In 1999, Nintendo stopped manufacturing the Japanese version of the "Koga's Ninja Trick" trading card because it depicted a [[swastika#Other Asian traditions|manji]], a traditionally [[Buddhist]] symbol with no negative connotations. The [[Judaism|Jewish]] civil rights group [[Anti-Defamation League]] complained because the symbol is the reverse of a [[swastika]], which is considered offensive to Jewish people. The cards were intended for sale in Japan only, but the popularity of Pokémon led to importation into the United States with approval from Nintendo. The Anti-Defamation League understood that the issue symbol was not intended to offend and acknowledged the sensitivity that Nintendo showed by removing the product.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4525479.html |title='Swastika' Pokemon card dropped |last=Fitzgerald|first=Jim|date=December 3, 1999|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211235110/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_19991203/ai_n13847438|archivedate=December 11, 2007}}</ref>

In 2001, [[Saudi Arabia]] banned Pokémon games and cards, alleging that the franchise promoted [[Zionism]] by displaying the [[Star of David]] in the trading cards (a six-pointed star is featured in the card game) as well as other religious symbols such as [[cross]]es they associated with [[Christianity]] and triangles they associated with [[Freemasonry]]; the games also involved gambling, which is in violation of [[Islam|Muslim]] doctrine.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/meast/03/26/saudi.pokemon/ |title=Saudi bans Pokemon |date=March 26, 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118135529/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/meast/03/26/saudi.pokemon/ |archivedate=January 18, 2008 | publisher=CNN}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1243307.stm|title=Saudi Arabia bans Pokemon|date=March 26, 2001|work=BBC News|accessdate=February 13, 2009}}</ref>

===''Monster in My Pocket''===
In March 2000, Morrison Entertainment Group, a small toy developer based at [[Manhattan Beach, California]], sued Nintendo over claims that Pokémon infringed on its own ''[[Monster in My Pocket]]'' characters.

==Cultural influence==
[[File:All Nippon Airways Boeing 747-400 yellow pokemon.jpg|thumb|[[All Nippon Airways]] [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747–400]] in Pokémon livery, dubbed a [[Pokémon Jet]].]]
Pokémon, being a popular franchise, has undoubtedly left its mark on [[popular culture|pop culture]]. The [[List of Pokémon characters|Pokémon characters]] themselves have become pop culture icons; examples include two different Pikachu balloons in the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]], Pokémon Jets operated by All Nippon Airways, thousands of merchandise items, and a [[Poképark|traveling theme park]] that was in [[Nagoya|Nagoya, Japan]] in 2005 and in [[Taipei]] in 2006. Pokémon also appeared on the cover of the U.S. magazine ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' in 1999. The Comedy Central show ''[[Drawn Together]]'' has a character named [[List of Drawn Together characters#Ling-Ling|Ling-Ling]] who is a direct parody of Pikachu.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://trsrockin.com/ripoffs.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080519064355/http://trsrockin.com/ripoffs.html |archivedate=May 19, 2008 |title=Pokemon Sightings and Rip-offs |accessdate=June 29, 2008 }}</ref> Several other shows such as ''[[ReBoot]]'', ''The Simpsons'', ''South Park'', ''[[The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy]]'', ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', ''[[All Grown Up!]]'' and ''[[Johnny Test]]'' have made references and spoofs of Pokémon, among other series. Pokémon was also featured on [[VH1]]'s ''[[I Love the '90s: Part Deux]]''. A live action show called ''[[Pokémon Live!]]'' toured the United States in late 2000. It was based on the popular Pokémon anime, but had some continuity errors relating to it. [[Jim Butcher]] cites Pokémon as one of the inspirations for the [[Codex Alera]] series of novels.

Joseph Jay Tobin theorizes that the success of the franchise was mainly due to the long list of names that could be learned by children and repeated in their peer groups. The rich fictional universe provided a lot of opportunities for discussion and demonstration of knowledge in front of their peers. In the French version Nintendo took care to translate the name of the creatures so that they reflected the French culture and language. In all cases the names of the creatures were linked to its characteristics, which converged with the children's belief that names have symbolic power. Children could pick their favourite Pokémon and affirm their individuality while at the same time affirming their conformance to the values of the group, and they could distinguish themselves from other kids by asserting what they liked and what they didn't like from every chapter. Pokémon gained popularity because it provided a sense of identity to a wide variety of children, and lost it quickly when many of those children found that the identity groups were too big and searched for identities that would distinguish them into smaller groups.<ref>{{cite book |title=Pikachu's global adventure: the rise and fall of Pokémon |author=Joseph Jay Tobin |publisher=[[Duke University Press]] |year=2004 |isbn=0-8223-3287-6 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=U7hthImoc5AC&q=naming#v=snippet&q=naming&f=false }}</ref>

In December 2009, a "Pokémon profile picture month" on popular [[social networking]] website [[Facebook]] started, with over 100,000 (by some estimates) Facebook users changing the image displayed on their profile webpages to that of a Pokémon. In 2010, more than 252,000 people replied as "attending", or taking part in, the event, at least double the previous year.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Facebook |year=2010 |accessdate=December 5, 2010 |title=Pokemon Profile Picture Month |url=http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=347947515181 }}</ref>

''Pokémon''{{'}}s history has been marked at times by rivalry with the ''[[Digimon]]'' media franchise that debuted at a similar time.
